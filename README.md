## Financial Consumer Complaints Dashboard

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Financial Consumer Complaints Dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard is designed to track and analyze consumer complaints across various financial products and services, offering valuable insights into trends and patterns in customer grievances.

### Key Features:

- **Complaint Tracking by Issue and State:**
  - The dashboard includes a detailed breakdown of complaints categorized by specific issues such as managing accounts, payment problems, and identity theft.
  - It provides a geographic distribution of complaints by state, enabling regional analysis of consumer dissatisfaction.

- **Submission Methods:**
  - Complaints are categorized based on the method of submission, including web, phone, email, postal mail, and fax. This feature helps in understanding the preferred communication channels of consumers.

- **Product Analysis:**
  - Complaints are segmented by product type, such as credit cards, mortgages, bank accounts, and student loans. This segmentation aids in identifying specific financial products that are prone to issues.

- **Resolution Metrics:**
  - The dashboard tracks key resolution metrics, including the percentage of complaints with timely responses and those resolved at no cost to the consumer. These metrics provide a measure of the responsiveness and effectiveness of financial institutions in addressing consumer issues.

- **Customer Dispute Rates:**
  - It includes a visualization of customer dispute rates, indicating the percentage of complaints that were disputed by customers. This metric highlights areas where consumers are dissatisfied with the initial resolution.


By synthesizing data from various sources and presenting it in an intuitive, interactive format, this dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to monitor and improve consumer satisfaction in the financial sector. It provides a clear picture of the current state of consumer complaints and aids in strategic decision-making to enhance service quality and customer experience.
